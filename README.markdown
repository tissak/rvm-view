## RVM-View

A tiny sinatra app that will delve into your .rvm folder and pull out details about what gems you have installed in your gemsets.

Clicking on a gemset link will display the hierarchy of root -> global -> gemset in one view so you can see all available gems.

## Usage

Clone the repo and then run "rvm-view". A browser window should pop up showing your gems or you can browse to http://localhost:8070/
